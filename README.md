# Engine

Toy game engine in C.

## Building

Currently this is only a backup, haven't think about collaboration yet.

If you really want to build it, you'll need to:

- Have a Windows machine (only works on Windows 10 now)
- Get gcc + MinGW64
- Get a `sh` shell (for `build.sh`, although it's pretty simple to translate to other shells)
- Get a static binary of GLFW
- Compiling the `glad` and `stb` sources in repo
- Find some assets (bitmaps and fonts not checked in yet)
